# AdaptiveGridViewCpp
A version of the AdaptiveGridView from the Windows Community Toolkit written in C++/WinRT

I have taken the source code from the WindowsCommunityToolkit (https://github.com/windows-toolkit/WindowsCommunityToolkit) and re-wrote the AdaptiveGridView control (and its sample app) from its origina C# to a Runtime Component written in C++/WinRT

I completed this just to 'see' what C++/WinRT is like. 

The C++ code probably isnt the best in the world, but we can agree that it works reasonably well.

Feel free to improve it - pull requests welcome
